#computer terminologies-

Algorithm: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task, often used in programming and data processing.

API (Application Programming Interface): A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

Array: A data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type, allowing efficient data retrieval.

Binary Tree: A hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, used for efficient searching and sorting.

Bit: The smallest unit of data in a computer, represented as a 0 or 1, forming the basis of all computing.

Boolean: A data type that can hold one of two possible values: true or false, often used in logic operations and conditions.

Cache: A small-sized type of volatile storage that provides high-speed data access to a processor and stores frequently used data.

Class: A blueprint in object-oriented programming that defines the properties and behaviors (methods) of objects.

Compiler: A program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code.

Data Structure: A way of organizing and storing data in a computer so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Database: An organized collection of structured information or data, typically managed by a Database Management System (DBMS).

Debugging: The process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing bugs or errors in software or hardware.

Encapsulation: An object-oriented programming principle that restricts direct access to some components of an object, promoting modularity.

Encryption: The process of converting data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access.

Frontend: The part of a web application or software that users interact with directly, including user interface design and user experience.

Git: A version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development, allowing for collaboration and history tracking.

Hash Function: A function that converts input data of any size into a fixed-size string of text, typically used in data integrity and password storage.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol used for transferring hypertext requests and information on the web.

IDE (Integrated Development Environment): A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development, including code editing, debugging, and testing.

Inheritance: An object-oriented programming concept where a new class derives properties and behaviors from an existing class.

IP Address: A unique string of numbers assigned to each device connected to a network, used for identifying and locating devices.

JavaScript: A high-level, dynamic programming language commonly used for creating interactive effects within web browsers.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): A lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

Kernel: The core part of an operating system that manages system resources and allows communication between hardware and software.

Loop: A programming construct that repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Machine Learning: A subset of artificial intelligence that uses algorithms to enable computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.

Node: A basic unit of a data structure, such as a tree or graph, that contains data and may link to other nodes.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods.

Packet: A formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network, containing control information and user data.

Polymorphism: An object-oriented programming feature that allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

Queue: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are added at one end and removed from the other.

RAM (Random Access Memory): A type of volatile memory used by computers to store data that is being actively used or processed.

Repository: A centralized location where data, code, or files are stored and managed, often used in version control systems.

Runtime: The period during which a program is executing, as opposed to compile time when the program is being compiled.

Server: A computer or system that provides data, resources, or services to other computers over a network.

SQL (Structured Query Language): A standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.

Stack: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end.

Syntax: The set of rules that defines the structure and format of statements in a programming language.

Thread: A sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, allowing for concurrent execution.

URL (Uniform Resource Locator): The address used to access resources on the internet, typically starting with http:// or https://.

UX (User Experience): The overall experience and satisfaction a user has when interacting with a product or service, particularly in software design.

Virtual Machine: A software emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications as if they were on a physical machine.

Web Framework: A software framework designed to aid the development of web applications, providing tools and libraries for building robust applications.

XML (eXtensible Markup Language): A markup language used to encode documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

Source Code: The human-readable instructions written in a programming language that make up a computer program.

Middleware: Software that connects different applications or services, enabling them to communicate and manage data exchange.

Cloud Computing: The delivery of computing services—such as storage, processing, and software—over the internet, allowing for scalable resources.

Agile Methodology: A project management approach that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility in responding to change.

Open Source: Software whose source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute, promoting collaboration and innovation.

DevOps: A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle and improve deployment frequency.
